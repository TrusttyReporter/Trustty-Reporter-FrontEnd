    <p>To use Trustty Reporter, you must create an account by registering directly on our website or via Google login. You are required to provide accurate and current information, including your name and email address.

    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>Trustty Reporter provides its services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. While we strive to provide reliable and error-free AI functionalities, we cannot guarantee that our services will always operate without faults. We expressly disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Trustty Reporter does not warrant the accuracy of the AI-generated reports or the uninterrupted availability of our services.</p>
    <p>In no event will Trustty Reporter or its suppliers be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use our services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses resulting from the operation or failure of the AI services. Specifically, Trustty Reporter will not be responsible for any interruptions, inaccuracies, or errors in the AI-generated content or for any decisions made based on such content.</p>
    <p>The limitation of liability extends to all claims under any legal theory, whether the damages were foreseeable and regardless of whether Trustty Reporter was advised of the possibility of such damages. As some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, some of these limitations may not apply to you. Users are encouraged to understand their rights under their local laws, which may provide additional protections.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Accuracy of Materials</h2>
    <p>The content and materials provided on the Trustty Reporter website, including guidelines on using our AI tools to generate, edit, and refine reports, are intended for general information purposes and are not exhaustive. While Trustty Reporter strives to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information presented, we do not warrant that descriptions of our services or other content on this website are complete, reliable, or error-free.</p>
    <p>The AI tool analyses user-uploaded PDF and CSV files to create reports; however, the accuracy of the reports depends significantly on the data provided by users. Trustty Reporter is not liable for inaccuracies in the AI-generated reports that may arise from erroneous or incomplete user data. Users should not solely rely on the generated reports for critical decision-making but should consult additional sources of information. Additionally, due to the dynamic nature of AI technology and our ongoing improvements, the information on our website may change without prior notice. Users are responsible for staying updated with such changes to ensure they are making the most of Trustty Reporter's capabilities.</p>

Additionally, our services utilise Stripe and Razorpay for payment processing, SendGrid for email communications, and several AI technologies such as the OpenAI API, Anthropic API, and Mistral AI API for advanced data processing capabilities. We also employ API analytics tools to monitor and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services.</p>
